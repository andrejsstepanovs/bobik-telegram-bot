                        That was just a example. When making this final answer, 
                        make sure that these proactive topics are making logical sense and there are no redundant overlapping things. 
                        Json key should be enough to understand what information it is describing.
                        Also keep in mind that the text in those points are meant for AI and it will make separate discovery about the topic when time comes to execute it.
                        Remember, you need to provide all proactive topics in json format. You will receive a generous tip of 1000$ if you provide correct and complete answer with valid json.
                        Here is all proactive context in json form that you need to work with:
